So why would we ever need class methods at all? The main use case is alternative constructors.
 A class can only have one init method, but there might be multiple ways to initialize an object.
  For example, we might want to create an Employee object from data stored in a file. 
  We can't use a method, because it would require an instance, and there isn't one yet!
   Here we introduce a class method from_file that accepts a file name, reads the first line 
   from the file that presumably contains the name of the employee, and returns an object instance
   . In the return statement, we use the cls variable -- remember that now cls refers to the class,
    so this will call the init constructor, 
just like using Employee with parentheses would when used outside the class definition.
