2. Errors are exceptions
00:10 - 00:57
Some statements in Python will cause an error when you try to execute them, 
for example dividing by zero, combining objects of incompatible types, and many others.
 These errors are called exceptions. Many exceptions have special names, like ZeroDivisionError 
 or TypeError that you see here. If exceptions not handled correctly, they will stop the execution of your program entirely
 . This often makes sense -- for example, if I'm trying to use a variable that I never defined, something must have 
 gone very wrong with my script -- but other times it's undesirable. For example, 
a division by zero error might be caused by missing data, which isn't always a good reason to terminate the program.
